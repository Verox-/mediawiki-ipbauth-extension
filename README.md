# mediawiki-ipbauth-extension
Single-Sign-On extension for Mediawiki and IPBoard

This is a modified version of IPBAuth to work with the latest version of IPB3, 3.4.6. 
How to use: Install extension as per Auth extension instructions on the Mediawiki website. Modify ipbauth_conf.php to use your IPB database prefix, if used. 
Modify access groups and admin groups to relate to ipboard group IDs you wish to access your wiki. 

If you have issues with this plugin send me a message and I'll try to help but I offer no guarentees, I have simply made this available with my own modifications so it works with 3.4.6 as nobody else has.
